Repeated Capabilities
=====================

    Repeated capabilities attributes are used to set the `channel_string` parameter to the
    underlying driver function call. This can be the actual function based on the :py:class:`Session`
    method being called, or it can be the appropriate Get/Set Attribute function, such as :c:`niScope_SetAttributeViInt32()`.

    Repeated capabilities attributes use the indexing operator :python:`[]` to indicate the repeated capabilities.
    The parameter can be a string, list, tuple, or slice (range). Each element of those can be a string or
    an integer.

    The recommended way of accessing repeated capabilities is with an integer :python:`[0]` or range :python:`[0:2]`.

channels
--------

    .. py:attribute:: niscope.Session.channels[]

        .. code:: python

            session.channels[0].channel_enabled = True

        sets :py:attr:`channel_enabled` to :python:`True` for channels 0.

        .. code:: python

            session.channels[0:2].channel_enabled = True
        
        sets :py:attr:`channel_enabled` to :python:`True` for channels 0, 1, 2.

        Note that :py:attr:`channel_enabled` is only used as an example and is not necessarily a property which
        supports this repeated capability. See documentation for individual properties and methods to
        learn what repeated capabilites they support, if any.

instruments
-----------

    .. py:attribute:: niscope.Session.instruments[]

        .. code:: python

            session.instruments[0].channel_enabled = True

        sets :py:attr:`channel_enabled` to :python:`True` for instruments 0.

        .. code:: python

            session.instruments[0:2].channel_enabled = True
        
        sets :py:attr:`channel_enabled` to :python:`True` for instruments 0, 1, 2.

        Note that :py:attr:`channel_enabled` is only used as an example and is not necessarily a property which
        supports this repeated capability. See documentation for individual properties and methods to
        learn what repeated capabilites they support, if any.
